Bounce Effect Animation of Table View Cell in order to show a Delete View 

Have you ever seen an animation of a cell that shows us that there is a possibility of swiping a cell in order to delete it? 
Well, if you ever wondered how to do this kind of "hint" - here it is! 
It is not a nice idea to do that using a system delete view as it is a private view.
So, a great solution is to create custom delete view that is identical to the system one!

This small project is just perfect if you are searching for an inspiration how to implement such a hint in your application. You can show it once after user adds first cell to the table view. Let the user know that he can swipe to delete!

Check how this interesting piece of code works! :)
